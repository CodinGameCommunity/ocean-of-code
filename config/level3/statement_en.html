        </h2>
        <div class="statement-goal-content">
            This game is based on the board game Captain Sonar. <br>
            You pilot a submarine and you know that an enemy is present near you because you are listening to its radio frequency communication.
            You don't know exactly where it is but you can hear all its orders.
            You and your opponent have <const>6</const> hit points. When a player's hit points reach <const>0</const>, the player loses.

        <div><div class="statement-rules-content">
            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submarines move on a map constituted of water and islands. They can only move on cells with water. They can share the same cell without colliding.</li>
                <li>The map is <const>15</const> cells in width and <const>15</const> cells in height. Coordinates start at (0,0) which is the top left cell of the map.</li>
                <li>The map is split in <const>9</const> sectors, which contain <const>25</const> cells each (5x5 blocks of cells). The top left sector is <const>1</const>. The bottom right sector is <const>9</const>.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Beginning of the game</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the game, you'll receive a map (15x15 cells) that indicates the position of islands.
                Islands are obstacles. You cannot move or fire through islands. Then, you will decide where you want to place your submarine by indicating a coordinate (x,y).
            </p>


            <h2> Each turn</h2>
            <p>This is a turn based game which means that each player plays a turn one after the other. The player with the id 0 begins.
                During your turn, thankfully to your radio frequency analysis, you will receive an indication of what your opponent has done.
                For example, you can receive that it moved to the north. It's up to you to use this valuable information to detect where it is. Then, you must perform at least one action.
            </p>

            <h2>Actions</h2>
            <p>
                Each turn you must perform at least one action. You can do several actions by chaining them using the pipe <const>|</const>.
                But you can use each type of action only once per turn (you can move one time per turn, no more).
                If you fail to output a valid action, you will SURFACE in that turn.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Move</strong></p>
            A move action moves your submarine <const>1</const> cell in a given direction (north, east, south, west) and charges a power of your choice.
            When you move, you must respect the following rules:
            <ul><li> You cannot move through islands</li>
                <li>You cannot move on a cell you already visited before</li>
            </ul>
            You can decide, what to charge. Different devices require a different amount of charges to be ready.
            You can charge the torpedo, the sonar, the silence mode and mines.

            <br><br><p><strong>Surface</strong></p>
            By using surface you will reset your path of visited cells so that you can freely move to a cell that you have previously visited.
            But surfacing has a major impact: your opponent will know in which sector you are surfacing and you lose <const>1</const> hit point.

            <br><br><p><strong>Torpedo</strong></p>
            A torpedo requires <const>3</const> charge actions to be ready.
            When fully charged, the torpedo can be fired at an arbitrary water position within a range of <const>4</const> cells.
            This allows the torpedo's path to contain corners and go around islands, but not through them.
            The damage of the explosion is <const>2</const> on the cell itself and <const>1</const> on all neighbors (including diagonal ones). You can also damage yourself with a torpedo.
            The following image illustrates the range of a torpedo: <br>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodinGameCommunity/ocean-of-code/master/torpedoRange.png">

             <br><br><p><strong>Sonar</strong></p>
            Sonar requires <const>4</const> charge actions to load.
            It allows you to check, if the opponent's submarine is in a given sector. You will get the response in your next turn.
            This is in respect to the time of issuing the command, not after the opponent moved.

            <br><br><p><strong>Silence</strong></p>
            Silence requires <const>6</const> charge actions to load.
            This allows you to move <const>0</const> to <const>4</const> cells in a given direction (not visiting already visited cells or islands).
            Your opponent will not know in which direction or how far you've moved.

            <div style="color: #7cc576;
        background-color: rgba(124, 197, 118,.1);
        padding: 2px;">
            <br><br><p><strong>Mine</strong></p>
            Mine requires <const>3</const> charge actions to load.
            It can be placed on any cell next to you (north, east, south, west).
            You can't place two own mines on the same cell. However it's possible to place your own mine on an opponent mine or the opponent's submarine itself.
            Mines will only detonate when using the trigger command, not when moving onto them.

            <br><br><p><strong>Trigger</strong></p>
            Triggering a mine will cause an explosion. You can only trigger your own mines.
            Like for a torpedo, the explosion has a damage of <const>2</const> on the location of the mine and <const>1</const> damage to nearby cells (including diagonally).
            You can't trigger multiple mines in the same turn. You can't place and trigger a mine in the same turn. You can also damage yourself with a mine.
            </div>
